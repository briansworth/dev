I'm Brian Farnsworth, an IT professional in Toronto. I got started with PowerShell, and fell in love with code, so I thought I'd share some of my experiences on this blog.  My beliefs are simple, I strive to simplify the technically complex, always think outside the box, and automate everything.

### More Information
This blog is intended to help anyone like myself who has a passion for scripting and automation.  Above all, I use this blog to document my effort, what works and what doesn't work.
Unfortunatly, I'm not independently wealthy, so a disclamer is necessary: all posts in this blog are provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.  The thoughts and opinions I express are my own, and not representative of my employer or any parties other than myself.
