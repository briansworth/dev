title: PowerShell - Automate SCCM PreReq Downloads
---

<p>
  I have recently started working with SCCM, 
  which means building (and rebuilding) lab environments for it. 
  I have found that just getting all the prerequisites installed can be 
  tedious and time consuming. 
  Even more so when your SCCM server is not connected to the internet.
</p>

### The Problem
----

<p>
  The SCCM Install requires prerequisites that, by default, 
  require internet connectivity.  
  Specifically there is a step in the SCCM Installation wizard that 
  asks you where to download your SCCM prereq files.  
  Additionally there is the ADK (and more recently the ADK WinPE Addon) 
  that require downloading their components from the internet.
</p>

### The Solution
----

<p>
  I have created a script that will be able to do the downloads 
  to a central folder of your choosing.
  Specifically, it will download the SCCM PreReq files, 
  the ADK files, and if required, the ADK WinPE Addon files.
</p>

#### What you need
----

<p>
  I know it's ridiculous that there are prereqs for downloading prereqs, 
  but it is what it is.
  You will need:
  <ol type="1">
    <li>SCCM installation media</li>
    <ul>
      <li>ISO must be mounted to a drive or extracted to a folder</li>
    </ul>
    <li>ADKSetup.exe</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Downloaded from Microsoft</li>
    </ul>
      <li>ADKWinPeSetup.exe</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Optional: The script will tell you if it is needed</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  With your environment ready, you can run the script. 
  Make sure you execute the script from the directory containing the 
  adksetup.exe file (and adkwinpesetup.exe file if required).
</p>

### Full Script
----

<p>
  I would recommend copying all the code below, 
  pasting it into a text editor, 
  then saving it as a ps1 file (SccmPreReqDl.ps1 for example).
</p>
*NOTE: There will be some examples below the code here*
```powershell

    -msg "Waiting for SCCM PreReq download to finish"

  Write-Host "PreReq Download completed. Check folder [$prereqTargetPath]"
}Catch{
  Write-Error $_
}
```

#### Example 1

```powershell
.\SccmPreReqDl.ps1 -sccmInstallSource D:\ -prereqTargetPath C:\temp\sccmPreReqs
```
<p>
  Description: This will download all files to the 'C:\temp\sccmPreReqs 
  folder.  The SCCM ISO file has been mounted to the D:\ drive, 
  so we point the -sccmInstallSource parameter to that drive letter.
</p>

#### Example 2

```powershell
.\SccmPreReqDl.ps1 -sccmInstallSource C:\Temp\SccmExtracted -Verbose
```
<p>
  Description: If you have extracted the SCCM ISO file to your C:\Temp drive 
  you can specify the path to the folder that contains the Installation media. 
  This will use the default location for the downloaded files.
</p>


### What now
----
<p>
  I will be writing a Part 2 to this post that can handle the install.  
  See below if you want to do it yourself.
</p>
<p>
  In short; you just need to copy the folder over to the SCCM server. 
  Once there, you can run the adksetup.exe file from the adk folder. 
  and run the adkwinpesetup.exe file from the corresponding folder if required.
  Then during the SCCM installation wizard, 
  choose the 'prereq' folder when asked to choose a folder with the prereq files.
</p>
