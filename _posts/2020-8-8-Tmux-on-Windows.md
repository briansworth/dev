title: Tmux on Windows
description: Install and use Tmux on Windows, using the WSL
---

I do a ton of work on the command line in Linux and Windows.
One of my favorite apps that makes working on the command line more efficient is Tmux.
There hasn't been anything quite like it in Windows, until now.

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) changes all of this.

Here are the steps for installing the WSL on Windows, and installing Tmux.

## Step 1: Install WSL

----

If you haven't already done so, install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
# Will likely require and prompt for a reboot
# If you want to upgrade to WSL2, do not reboot yet, otherwise reboot now
```

*NOTE**: **If you are on Windows 2004 or later,*
*you should install WSL 2 for better performance / supportability.*

*Second NOTE**: **If you are running this on a VM like VirtualBox,*
*you will need to use WSL 1*

## Step 2 (Optional): Upgrade to WSL2

----

Enable Virtual Machine Platform feature

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform
# Will likely require and prompt for a reboot
# Go ahead and reboot
```

Set WSL2 as the default WSL version

```powershell
wsl --set-default-version 2
# Will likely require updating the kernel, Visit https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel
# Install the new kernel and reboot if needed
```

## Step 3: Install a Linux distro from the Windows store

----

In the Windows store, you can search for your preferred Linux distribution.
Not all are available, 
but I have successfully used Ubuntu, Debian, and Kali Linux

## Step 4 (Optional): Install Windows Terminal from the Windows store.

----

Since you are in the Windows Store, 
I would recommend installing the Windows Terminal. 


## Step 5: Launch the Linux distro application to complete the installation

----

Run the application you installed from the Windows store; 
it should be available on the start menu once it is installed.

Complete the initial user setup:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/wsl-ubuntu-usersetup.png)


## Step 6 (Optional): If you installed the Windows Terminal, 

----

If you launch the Windows Terminal now, 
in the drop-down menu you should now have an option to select your Linux distro

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/windowsterminal-shellselect.png)


## Step 6: Install tmux

----

Open up the Linux distro app 
(or launch it from the Windows Terminal if you have it installed).
Update / upgrade the applications using the package manager

*For Ubuntu / Debian / Kali Linux*

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

# If using Ubuntu, Tmux should be installed already
sudo apt install tmux
```

## Step 7: Launch

----

```bash
tmux
```

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tmuxandkeepcalm.png)

Now you can multiplex your terminals til the cows come home.

I will go into detail on configuring Tmux in VIM style in a future post.
